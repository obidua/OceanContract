## Income Streams

**How it Works:**

- Earnings accumulate until you claim them
- Maximum 4x your initial stake

**Booster Qualification:**
- Activate 5+ direct referrals within 10 days
- Team volume must be ≥ your stake amount
- Doubles your rate to 1% per day permanently

**Example:**
- Stake: $1,000
- Daily Rate: 0.5% = $5/day
- Monthly: $150
- Reach 4x cap in 800 days
- **With Booster**: $10/day, $300/month, reach cap in 400 days

---

### 2. Direct Income

**What is it?**
Earn instant 5% commission on every direct referral who stakes.

**How it Works:**
1. Share your unique referral link
2. When someone joins using your link and stakes (minimum $50)
3. You receive 5% of their stake amount instantly to your Safe Wallet

**Payment Details:**
- Paid to: Safe Wallet
- Payment timing: Instant
- Fee: 0%
- Limits: Unlimited referrals

**Example:**
- You refer 20 people who each stake $500
- Total stakes: 20 × $500 = $10,000
- **Your commission: $500 (5% of $10,000)**

---

### 3. Slab Income System

**What is it?**
Earn a share of the 60% pool from your team's daily growth based on your slab qualification level.

**How it Works:**
- 60% of all team members' daily growth goes to a distribution pool
- Your share percentage depends on your slab level
- Qualified volume determines your slab level (40:30:30 from top 3 legs, or 100% with 4+ legs)
- Must have 1 new direct referral to claim slab earnings

**Slab Levels & Percentages:**

| Slab | Volume Required | Pool Share | Min Directs |
|------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| 1. Coral Reef | $500 | 5% | 1 |
| 2. Shallow Waters | $2,500 | 10% | 2 |
| 3. Tide Pool | $10,000 | 15% | 3 |
| 4. Wave Crest | $25,000 | 20% | 4 |
| 5. Open Sea | $50,000 | 25% | 5 |
| 6. Deep Current | $100,000 | 30% | 6 |
| 7. Ocean Floor | $500,000 | 35% | 7 |
| 8. Abyssal Zone | $1M | 45% | 8 |
| 9. Mariana Trench | $2.5M | 50% | 9 |
| 10. Pacific Master | $5M | 55% | 10 |
| 11. Ocean Sovereign | $20M | 60% | 11 |

**Example:**
- You qualify for Slab 7 (Ocean Floor) with $500K team volume
- Team generates $500/day in daily growth
- 60% to pool = $300
- Your 35% share = $105/day
- **Monthly earnings: $3,150**

**Key Points:**
- Continues even after you hit your 4x cap
- Higher slab = bigger share of the 60% pool
- Requires consistent team building

---

### 4. Slab Income (From Uplines)

**What is it?**
When you're a higher slab than your upline, you receive the difference.

**How it Works:**
- If your upline is at a lower slab than you
- You earn the difference percentage from the 60% pool
- Encourages everyone to progress together

**Example:**
- You're at Slab 7 (35%)
- Your upline is at Slab 5 (25%)
- You earn the 10% difference on their pool share

---

### 5. Same-Slab Override

**What is it?**
Earn from downline members in the same slab as you (20% of the 60% pool).

**How it Works:**
- When downline members reach your same slab level
- You earn additional bonuses on their activity
- Distributed across 3 levels:
  - **First Wave (L1)**: 10% override
  - **Second Wave (L2)**: 5% override
  - **Third Wave (L3)**: 5% override

**Example:**
- You're at Slab 7
- 3 downline members also reach Slab 7
- You earn override bonuses from their pool shares
